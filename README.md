Enthusiastic Machine Learning Engineer with experience in Data Science. Passionate about community and technology. Love to learn new things and experiment crazy projects :D 

## CV Development

> Your CV is one of the most important key elements to prepare you for after-school. 

> Prepare your CV, Updatable format (docx, latex, template), PDF of current version

> Update your CV's version every month (It is okay not to change something every month but check with yourself every month to keep CV updated)

> I personally recommend using Latex, because looks professional. I also recommend to have a GitHub Repository to store CV since Git has an automatic version control.

> For example [myCV](https://github.com/eneskemalergin/My_CV) is on GitHub and developed using Latex 

> If you have CV as a GitHub account, add the link under this section
